# RSA CODE CHALLENGE
Your friend Jonas is deeply worried. He strictly obeys the COVID-19 precautionary measures, but still he heard that 
[you are not alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAyKJAtDNCw). In fact, even when completely isolated,
[you'll never walk alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV5_LQArLa0).
He decides that, from now on, he will only communicate in a secure way.
After putting on his tinfoil hat, he contacts you via [fakeboook messenger](https://www.quora.com/How-secure-is-Facebook-Messenger).

He persuades you to encrypt all text messages with the [RSA cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)).
To have a common language, you and your friend agree on the specifications described in the following exercises.

For encryption you gave Jonas your *alphabet length* and *public key* `296486947843193941439192679364878082685665921322009083714907` and `65537`.
The alphabet was generated by the prime numbers `447816969936417125298328813691`
and `662071711764943530683672047777`, which are only known to you.

You do not hear from you friend for two weeks, but then one night at 2 in the morning Jonas sends you the message.
